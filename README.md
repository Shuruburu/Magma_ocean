# 🌋 Atmospheric Modeling of Magma Rocky Planets

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for our project on **atmospheric modeling of magma-covered rocky planets**.  
This research aims to simulate and analyze the **thermal, chemical, and dynamic properties** of exoplanetary atmospheres under extreme surface conditions.  

The project was originally proposed by **Sean Jordan**  and is being developed by **Jan Jerzy Sokal**
